### Key Features of the Plugin

- **Naming Conventions**: Enforces PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables, and kebab-case for filenames.
- **Function Complexity**: Restricts the number of lines per function and limits the number of function parameters.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that your entire team follows the same coding standards.

### Try an Example of an ESLint Rule

Let's take a look at how `@mindfiredigital/eslint-plugin-hub` enforces naming conventions. Here's a small piece of code:

```js
class userprofile {
  getuserdata() {
    return 'data';
  }
}
```

This code violates the **PascalCase** naming convention for class names and the **camelCase** convention for function names.

<button onClick={() => alert('Violations: Class name and function names should be PascalCase and camelCase respectively.')}>Check Violations</button>

### Correct Code

Hereâ€™s how the code should look after applying the rules enforced by the plugin:

```js
class UserProfile {
  getUserData() {
    return 'data';
  }
}
```

By using `@mindfiredigital/eslint-plugin-hub`, your team can ensure that everyone writes code in a uniform way, making it easier to read and maintain.

Feel free to play around with these rules in your project by installing the plugin:

```bash
npm install @mindfiredigital/eslint-plugin-hub --save-dev
```

### Conclusion

Consistent code not only helps avoid errors but also makes onboarding new developers easier. With this ESLint plugin, you can enforce these best practices automatically.
