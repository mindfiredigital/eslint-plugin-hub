# Introduction

**eslint-plugin-hub** is a comprehensive ESLint plugin designed to help enforce code quality and consistency across various JavaScript and TypeScript projects. The plugin provides a set of custom linting rules that help developers maintain a high standard of coding practices while adhering to specific conventions for general, React, and Angular projects.

By integrating **eslint-plugin-hub** into your workflow, you can enforce strict naming conventions, file structure guidelines, and other coding best practices. This plugin allows teams to maintain cleaner codebases, minimize bugs, and improve collaboration.

## Key Features

- **General Rules**: A wide range of rules for common coding standards such as naming conventions, file structure, and variable declarations, applicable to any JavaScript or TypeScript project.
- **React-Specific Rules**: Enforce coding standards specific to React applications, ensuring best practices for component structure, hook usage, and JSX formatting.
- **Angular-Specific Rules**: Enforce Angular-specific coding conventions, ensuring consistency in component, service, and module development.
- **Customizable Options**: Each rule is configurable, allowing you to tailor the plugin to your project’s unique needs.
- **TypeScript Support**: Out-of-the-box support for linting TypeScript files (`.ts` and `.tsx`), ensuring that both JavaScript and TypeScript projects maintain the same level of quality and consistency.

## Why Use eslint-plugin-hub?

The primary goal of **eslint-plugin-hub** is to provide an all-in-one solution for maintaining code quality and consistency in JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Here are some reasons why you should integrate this plugin into your development workflow:

- **Enforce Consistent Coding Standards**: Ensure that your entire team follows the same rules and standards across different projects, reducing the risk of bugs and increasing code readability.
- **Improved Collaboration**: By enforcing uniform practices, code reviews become easier, and team members can collaborate more effectively.
- **React and Angular Focused**: Tailored rules for React and Angular development help streamline coding practices for component-based architectures, reducing boilerplate and avoiding common pitfalls.
- **Highly Configurable**: Each rule can be customized to fit your project's specific needs, whether you're enforcing naming conventions, limiting the number of function parameters, or standardizing folder and file naming.
- **Increased Code Quality**: Consistent, clean code helps prevent bugs and makes future refactoring or scaling of the codebase easier.

## Available Rule Categories

The plugin is divided into three main categories:

- **General Rules**: Applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript projects, ensuring consistency in code structure, naming conventions, and code formatting.
- **React Rules**: Ensures best practices in React development, covering component naming, hooks, and JSX syntax.
- **Angular Rules**: Focuses on Angular-specific guidelines, including consistent naming and structure for components, services, and modules.

Each category comes with a set of rules that you can enable or configure based on your project’s needs.
