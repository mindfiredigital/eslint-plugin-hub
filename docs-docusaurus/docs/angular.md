## Angular Plugin Configuration

To ensure consistent coding standards and best practices in Angular projects, the ESLint Plugin Hub provides several Angular-specific rules. These rules enforce best practices for naming conventions, component structure, and the usage of services, inputs, and DOM manipulation within Angular projects.

### Angular Rules

| Rule Name                            | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `angular-no-forbidden-services`      | Disallows usage of forbidden Angular services.                  |
| `angular-no-unused-inputs`           | Disallows unused inputs in Angular components.                  |
| `angular-no-direct-dom-manipulation` | Disallows direct DOM manipulation in Angular components.        |
| `angular-limit-input`                | Enforces a limit on the number of inputs in Angular components. |
| `angular-filenaming`                 | Enforces consistent naming conventions for Angular files.       |

### Configuration

After installing the plugin, you'll need to add the Angular-specific rules from `eslint-plugin-hub` to your ESLint configuration file (e.g., `eslintrc.config.mjs`,`.eslintrc.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, or `.eslintrc.yaml`).

Hereâ€™s how to configure the Angular-specific rules:

### Import Angular Rules

```javascript
import hub from '@mindfiredigital/eslint-plugin-hub';
import globals from 'globals';

export default [
  // Extends the angular config preset from the plugin
  hub.configs['flat/angular'],
  {
    languageOptions: {
      globals: globals.builtin,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2022,
        sourceType: 'module',
      },
    },
    // Add any additional rules or overrides here
  },
];
```

or

```json
{
  "env": {
    "es2024": true
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "extends": ["plugin:@mindfiredigital/hub/angular"]
  // Add any additional rules or overrides here
}
```

### Angular Rule Details

#### `angular-no-forbidden-services`

This rule disallows the usage of forbidden Angular services in your project. You can configure a list of forbidden services, ensuring that only authorized services are used.

- **Default Level**: `error`
- **Rationale**: Some services, such as certain legacy or deprecated ones, should not be used in new codebases.

```json
"hub/angular-no-forbidden-services": ["error", { "forbiddenServices": ["$http", "$scope"] }]
```

#### `angular-no-unused-inputs`

This rule checks for unused inputs in Angular components. It warns when an `@Input()` property is declared but not used inside the component's template or logic.

- **Default Level**: `warn`
- **Rationale**: Unused inputs add unnecessary complexity and can lead to confusion.

```json
"hub/angular-no-unused-inputs": "warn"
```

#### `angular-no-direct-dom-manipulation`

This rule disallows direct DOM manipulation within Angular components. Angular provides a declarative approach to working with the DOM, and bypassing that with direct manipulation can lead to hard-to-maintain code.

- **Default Level**: `error`
- **Rationale**: Direct DOM manipulation is discouraged in Angular since it goes against Angular's reactive, declarative architecture.

```json
"hub/angular-no-direct-dom-manipulation": "error"
```

#### `angular-limit-input`

This rule enforces a limit on the number of `@Input()` properties that can be declared in a component. You can configure the maximum number of inputs allowed.

- **Default Level**: `warn`
- **Rationale**: A large number of inputs can make a component difficult to manage and maintain. Limiting inputs encourages better component design.

```json
"hub/angular-limit-input": ["warn", { "maxInputs": 5 }]
```

#### `angular-filenaming`

This rule enforces a consistent naming convention for Angular files. By default, it checks that all Angular files follow a kebab-case naming convention.

- **Default Level**: `error`
- **Rationale**: Consistent naming conventions help in organizing and maintaining code in large projects.

```json
"hub/angular-filenaming": ["error", { "namingConvention": "kebab-case" }]
```

### Conclusion

These Angular-specific ESLint rules are designed to promote better coding practices and maintainability in Angular projects. By enforcing limits on inputs, disallowing direct DOM manipulation, and following naming conventions, you'll ensure a clean, maintainable, and efficient codebase.
